# R-Plotting
This is a repository for scripts to make plots diagnostic or repetitious in R 

Often I find myself needed to make many plots of the same thing. Hence it's easier to write a function and call that function over and over. Instead of storing these scripts in some forgotten directory I want to post them here so that I can easily access them and share them with other. 

Most of these scripts will use the ggplot2 library since it's graphics are completely customizable. I encourage anyone to use them and modify them to fit your specific needs.

Here is a list of the scripts and their purpose:
1. Variant linearity - reads in 2 vcf files and creates a scatterplot of the allele frequencies
